Description: In this knowledge transfer session, we will learn about web automation using Selenium. Participants will learn how to set up Selenium, integrate it with Maven for managing dependencies, utilize the power of test annotations (@BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod), and create test cases with assertion statements. Additionally, we will explore element locating strategies, interaction techniques, and assertion practices by automating scenarios on three different websites: automationpractice.com, saucedemo.com, and tehnomanija.rs.
 
	1. Selenium Setup and Maven Integration: We'll start by introducing Selenium, a powerful tool for automating web browsers, and guide participants through the process of setting up Selenium WebDriver in their development environment. Furthermore, we'll explore Maven, a widely used build management tool in Java projects, to handle dependencies effectively.
	2. Test Annotations: @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod: Participants will learn about the significance of test annotations and their role in test execution flow. The @BeforeMethod annotation allows for the setup of preconditions before each test method execution, while the @AfterMethod annotation enables cleanup actions after each test method execution. Understanding the proper use of these annotations ensures efficient test automation.
	3. Element Locating and Interaction on AutomationPractice.com: We will focus on automationpractice.com, a sample e-commerce website, and guide participants through the process of identifying web elements using various locating strategies. Participants will gain hands-on experience interacting with these elements through actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating between pages.
	4. Assertion Techniques for Test Validation: Effective validation of test outcomes is crucial in automation. Participants will learn how to use assertion statements to verify expected outcomes against actual results during test execution. This step is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of test cases.
	5. Automation on SauceDemo.com: Moving on to saucedemo.com, another e-commerce website, participants will apply the skills learned on automationpractice.com to create test cases for login scenarios. This practical exercise will reinforce element locating and interaction skills, as well as the use of assertions for test validation.
Hover Effect and Slide Interaction on Tehnomanija.rs: The final part of the knowledge transfer will focus on tehnomanija.rs
